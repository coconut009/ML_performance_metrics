# ML_performance_metrics
## This is the classifier comparison 
### By comparing three different algorithms' accuracy and computation time
All the source data file is download from __[UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php "UCI ML Respository Home Page")__ <br><br>
The first data set: __[Car Evaluation Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation)__
<br><br> 
The adaboost code in this repository is only good to classify two classes.
<br>
The data set downloaded from UCI ML repository has been modified to fit the adaboost lassifier 
<br>
The target label has been changed from 4 classes to 2 classes:
<br>
unacc => unacc
<br>
acc, good , v_good => acc
<br>
If the data sets have more than two classes(labels) the accuracy will be significant reduced
